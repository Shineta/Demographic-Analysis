✅ What You're Already Doing Well
✔ Data upload interface with feedback on row count and structure
✔ Demographic filters and EntityDesc selection
✔ Heat map visualization exists
✔ Demographic Gaps Analysis summary table is present
✔ Target % comparison logic is included

❌ What's Missing or Needs Fixing to Meet the Requirements
1. ✅ Module Total Counts (Per EntityDesc)
Problem:
There is no summary table that shows the total number of people represented per module.

Fix:
Add a “Module Summary Table” below the heat map or in a new tab:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
| EntityDesc                        | Grade | Component     | Total People |
|----------------------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Lesson, Ant's Grand Feast        | Gr. 1  | Read & Respond| 186           |
| Lesson, Rosa Parks: My Story     | Gr. 4  | Read & Respond| 202           |
This helps stakeholders quickly see which lessons have the most/least representation.

2. 🎯 Demographic Heat Map Not Readable or Labeled Clearly
Problem:

The heat map is not clearly labeled with demographic category axes or cell values.

It’s hard to tell what each row and column represents.

Fixes:

Label X-axis: Demographics (AAM, AAF, etc.)

Label Y-axis: Module name (EntityDesc) or Grade + Module

Use tooltips or on-hover labels to show:

Actual %

Target %

Total count in that cell

Optionally show a legend for color scale.

3. 🎚️ Filter Controls Need Enhancements
Problem:
Grade and Component filtering is great, but they’re not tightly coupled to heat map logic.

Fix:

Ensure that filters apply to both the heat map and the demographic gap table.

Allow toggling between:

Heat Map View

Gap Summary View

Module Totals View

4. 📊 Demographic Gap Table Is Underpowered
Problem:
The “Actual Count” and “Actual %” columns are mostly zeros, likely because filters are too narrow or data isn't parsed correctly.

Fix:

Validate that demographic columns are being read and summed properly

Ensure that filters (especially EntityDesc) don’t unintentionally exclude data

Show a message if filters return empty/no demographic hits

5. 📤 No Export Features Yet
Fix:
Add export options:

Export heat map as PNG/PDF

Export module summary table as CSV

Export gap analysis table as Excel or PDF

6. 🧭 Guidance for Users
Fix:

Add a “How to Use” section or tooltip popovers

Clarify what “Over Target” or “On Target” means

Show default target values in a sidebar or allow admin customization
