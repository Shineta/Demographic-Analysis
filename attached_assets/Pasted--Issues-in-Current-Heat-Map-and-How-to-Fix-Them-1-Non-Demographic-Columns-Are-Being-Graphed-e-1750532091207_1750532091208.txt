üõ†Ô∏è Issues in Current Heat Map and How to Fix Them
1. ‚ùó Non-Demographic Columns Are Being Graphed (e.g., "Page Folio")
Issue:

Your heat map includes irrelevant columns like Page Folio, which are not demographic data.

This inflates the chart with incorrect values (e.g., +3690%).

Fix:

Add a column whitelist or filter to include only approved demographic fields like:

African American, Asian, Caucasian, Female, Hispanic, LGBT, Legacy, Male, Native American, Other, Pacific Islander, Physically Challenged

Alternatively, allow admins to select or confirm demographic columns during file upload.

2. ‚ùó Default Target % Is Hardcoded at 10% Across All Demographics
Issue:

All categories show as "-10.0%" or "+3690.0%", which suggests:

Actual values are 0%, and

Target is hardcoded at 10% for every demographic

Fix:

Allow custom target values for each demographic (via UI or config file)

If target data is present in the file, use that

Default to reasonable, equity-driven values if nothing is provided:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "African American": 12,
  "Asian": 5,
  "Hispanic": 18,
  "LGBT": 7,
  ...
}
3. ‚ùó No Hover Tooltips or Data Context in Cells
Issue:

Stakeholders can't see actual values or context behind each % bar

Fix:

Add hover tooltips showing:

Actual %

Target %

Raw Count (X out of Y)

Module Name

Example Tooltip:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Lesson: A Boat in the Wilderness
Demographic: African American
Actual: 2%
Target: 12%
Gap: -10%
Total People: 186
4. ‚ùó X-Axis Labels Are Cluttered and Unreadable
Issue:

The labels are too dense and overlapping, especially with "(10.0% target)" appended to each

Fix:

Use abbreviations or icons for demographics (e.g., AAM, AAF, LGBTF)

Show full demographic + target % on hover or tooltip

Rotate or wrap labels to improve readability

5. ‚ùó Heat Map Legend Is Compressed and Unclear
Issue:

The legend on the right is stacked vertically and unreadable

Fix:

Move legend to the top or bottom

Use a simple color scale bar:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
< - Under Target | On Target | Over Target >
     Red         White        Green
