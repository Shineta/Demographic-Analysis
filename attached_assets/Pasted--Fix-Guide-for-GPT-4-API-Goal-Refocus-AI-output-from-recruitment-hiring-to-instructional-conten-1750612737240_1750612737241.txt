✅ Fix Guide for GPT-4 API
Goal:
Refocus AI output from "recruitment/hiring" to "instructional content and curriculum representation."

🔧 1. Update Your Prompt
Old or generic prompt (likely causing HR-style output):
json
Copy
Edit
"Based on this demographic data, provide recommendations to improve equity and balance representation."
✅ Refined Prompt:
json
Copy
Edit
"You are analyzing demographic representation within K–8 educational curriculum modules. Based on the data provided, identify which modules are underrepresenting key demographic groups (e.g., African American, Female, LGBT, etc.).

Recommend specific **curriculum-level content updates** to better reflect those groups — such as revising characters, story settings, themes, illustrations, or vocabulary examples.

Avoid HR-style language. Do not recommend hiring, recruiting, outreach, or employee training. This analysis applies strictly to instructional materials, not staffing or organizational policies."
🧠 2. Use a System Message in Your Chat Setup (Optional, but helpful)
Set a system message in your messages array to define the assistant’s domain:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an education equity assistant helping align K–8 curriculum modules with demographic representation goals. Focus only on content (lessons, texts, visuals), not staffing or HR-related topics."
}
🧪 3. Sample GPT-4 API Payload (with fixed structure)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an education equity assistant helping align K–8 curriculum modules with demographic representation goals. Focus only on content (lessons, texts, visuals), not staffing or HR-related topics."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Based on the data below, identify underrepresented demographics in each module, and recommend instructional content changes (e.g., revising stories, adding more inclusive illustrations, updating themes).\n\n[Insert demographic gap table here]"
    }
  ]
}
✅ 4. Example Output (after applying the fix)
Instead of:

“Increase recruitment and outreach for Hispanic communities…”

You get:

“Lesson ‘Tomás and the Library Lady’ underrepresents Pacific Islander and LGBT characters. Consider revising the illustrations or adding a sidebar narrative that includes a Pacific Islander perspective. You could also introduce diverse family structures in related reading comprehension prompts.”

📌 Bonus: Add a Visual Tag to Clarify the Source
If you're showing this to the user in a UI, you can add a heading to clarify what type of analysis this is:

“📘 Curriculum Representation Suggestions (Not HR Guidance)”
